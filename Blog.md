# 🌞 My Summer of Bitcoin 2025 Journey: From Doubt to Determination

*Ohh how shall I put it?*

Just a year ago, before stepping into college life, I had no clue what “open source” even meant. I vaguely remember my seniors talking about SoB—some had cracked the initial screening, some were GSoC contributors, and the rest were just buzzing with excitement about pull requests and GitHub issues. To be honest, I had no idea what any of that meant.

But something clicked. While GSoC and LFX sounded equally prestigious, it was **Summer of Bitcoin (SoB)** that caught my attention. Maybe it was the blend of **finance** and **technology**. Maybe it was the mysterious appeal of Bitcoin. All I knew was—I felt drawn to it.

I’ve always been curious about how things work—especially systems involving money. Questions like *“How does Bitcoin even have value?”*, *“Why is its price so volatile?”*, *“Who created it?”* kept nudging at me. I didn’t care much about the stipend (and no, that’s not a humblebrag). I genuinely wanted to **learn**. There’s a saying I’ve grown up hearing—*“Where there is Saraswati (knowledge), there is Lakshmi (fortune).”* That principle has always guided me.

And so began my journey.

## 🧪 The GSoC Attempt That Didn’t Work Out

Before I tell you how SoB unfolded, I need to rewind a bit.

There was a GSoC mentorship program happening in my college. We were told to build a web application—sort of a mini hackathon—and based on that, a few would get mentored further. I gave it a solid shot. But I wasn’t selected.

At that moment, I genuinely felt open source wasn’t for me.

But the idea of PRs… GitHub… organizations… it never left my mind. It was like a song stuck on loop. Even though I didn’t get selected, something in me whispered, *“This is worth coming back to.”*

## ✨ The Spark Rekindles: SoB Applications Open!

Semester 1 ended. I had zero experience with GitHub. I was home, relaxing, when I suddenly found out that applications for **Summer of Bitcoin 2025** were live.

Boom.

I saw an opportunity to try again, this time with a clearer sense of purpose. It wasn’t just tech now—it was **Bitcoin** and **blockchain**—a space I had always wanted to understand better.

I started brushing up on the basics. Took a course. Revisited some old YouTube playlists on blockchain. Everything started making more sense now. So, I filled out the form: GitHub, LinkedIn, LeetCode, and that all-important essay—*“Why are you applying for SoB?”*

## 😨 Doubt Creeps In… and Then Magic Happens

Here comes the twist.

A friend of mine—who had solved over **250 LeetCode** questions—didn’t get selected. My roommate, who was deep into the **MERN stack**, got rejected too.

Me? I had solved just **50 LeetCode** problems.

I began losing hope.

But I kept **manifesting** that I’d get in. I didn’t know how, but I kept visualizing that email.

And then, three days later—*Boom!*

📩 **“Congratulations, you’ve been selected…”**

I still remember screaming in joy. Telling my parents. The excitement was unreal.

But SoB wasn’t done testing me yet…

## 💻 The Assignment Phase: Chaos & Redemption

We were given **4 hard assignments** to move to the next round.

Hard was an understatement.

I tried solving them locally—my brain was fried. The first one wasn’t even compiling. I was drowning.

Then a friend suggested using codespaces. And suddenly things started clicking.

It was **literally on the last day** of the deadline that I submitted Assignment 1. The rest? I completed all three in just under two weeks. I was back in the game.

## 🧑‍💻 Finding My Org: python-bitcoin-utils

Next came contributions.

My mentor told me to check out orgs from last year and pick one that fit my tech stack. At that point, I had just started learning Python.

That’s when I found **python-bitcoin-utils**. It was a perfect match.

My first PR? I added **2 OP\_CODES** to support Taproot script path and even wrote test cases.

Wasn’t expecting much, but… the next morning I got the email:

> *“Your PR has been merged.”*

That one moment **changed everything**.

I felt seen. I felt capable. I started diving deeper into the codebase. PRs followed. And I kept building.

## 🙏 A Mentor’s Faith, A Community’s Support

Even though my mentor Kostantinos Karasavvas was super busy, he still decided to apply as a mentor to SoB—and proposed the exact idea I had worked on: **PSBT support**, along with two more BIPs.

I can’t thank him enough.

There were rough patches too. Some PRs got closed. Some days I felt I wasn’t good enough. But **Mukund Gupta bhaiya** stood by me. His support, his lectures on Bitcoin, and his calm guidance helped me through the chaos.

---

## 📝 The Proposal: A Product of Sacrifice

I skipped classes. Pored through codebases. Researched late nights.

But in the end, my proposal took shape—strong, clear, and filled with genuine passion.

And finally, I was **accepted into SoB 2025**.

## 🚀 Where I Am Now

Right now, I’ve implemented the initial structure of the PSBT class and submitted several PRs:

* [PR #168](https://github.com/karask/python-bitcoin-utils/pull/168)
* [PR #169](https://github.com/karask/python-bitcoin-utils/pull/169)
* [PR #170](https://github.com/karask/python-bitcoin-utils/pull/170)
* [PR #171](https://github.com/karask/python-bitcoin-utils/pull/171)

Here’s my full proposal:

## 🌱 Final Words

This journey wasn’t about skill. It wasn’t about LeetCode stats or fancy projects.

It was about **resilience**, **curiosity**, and **faith**.

If you're someone who doubts whether you belong in open source or not, trust me—you do. You just need that one chance, that one push.

And maybe… just maybe… **Summer of Bitcoin** could be that spark for you, too.
